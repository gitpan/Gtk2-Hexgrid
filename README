Gtk2-Hexgrid

This module sipploes a widget that displays a grid of hexagons. At this
time only vertical orientation is supported, as in wesnoth. Choose the
dimensions, tile size, tile colors, alignment, border stuff, and give
it text, sprites or backgrounds to display.

This module was written for the purpose of displaying strategy board
games. For example, see "Survive!" and "Hey, That's my Fish!". A
hexagonal variant of Minesweeper would also be easy to write.

Don't count on this module to remain backwards-compatible.
